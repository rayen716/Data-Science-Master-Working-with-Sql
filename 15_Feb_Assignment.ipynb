    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans1. A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating. Computer databases typically store aggregations of data records or files that contain information, such as sales transactions, customer data, financials and product information.\n",
    "SQL, which stands for “Structured Query Language,” is the programming language that’s been widely used in managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS).\n",
    "NoSQL is a non-relational database, meaning it allows different structures than a SQL database (not rows and columns) and more flexibility to use a format that best fits the data. "

    "DROP - It is used to drop the whole table. With the help of the “DROP” command we can drop (delete) the whole structure in one go.\n",
    "TRUNCATE - It is used to delete all the rows of a relation (table) in one go. With the help of the “TRUNCATE” command, we can’t delete the single row as here WHERE clause is not used.\n",
